## Requirements

Rename `template.env` to `.env`, 
and fill out the values.
`TWITCH_CHANNEL_DEV` is not needed, but the others are.

You can generate a oauth [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)

You need node.js, [download](https://nodejs.org/en/)

After you've installed node.js, run `npm i` in the project directory, to install modules.

## Running the app

Open `start.bat`, or in project directory run `npm run start`.

For development run `npm run watch`, or `npm run dev` if you have a `TWITCH_CHANNEL_DEV` set.

## Hosting

I have it curently hosted on heroku.
